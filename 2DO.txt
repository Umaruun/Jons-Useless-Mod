Fix: Arrow bouncing back, Useless Machine missing part in model?

Finish all textures:
- Useless Food texture / could have like this white & red can with green goo
- Useless MultiTool texture / could have a stick with all tool heads from the sides as the recipe shows. (See the recipe) OR switch texture on use?
- Super useless block texture / like normal block, flashing, but maybe with more spiky texture on it
